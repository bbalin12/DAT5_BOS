The Lahman Baseball Database

2013 Version
Release Date: February 14, 2014

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Introduction

This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for
Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2013.  It includes data from
the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" 
leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and
Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875. 

This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to
make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What
started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a
team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the
largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available
anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key
contributors to this project.)

None of what we have done would have been possible without the
pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete
Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude
to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set
of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of
the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over
the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts.
Please vist their website (www.sabr.org).

This database can never take the place of a good reference book like 
The Baseball Encyclopedia.  But it will enable people do to the kind 
of queries and analysis that those traditional sources don't allow.

If you have any problems or find any errors, please let us know.  Any 
feedback is appreciated

2.0 Data Tables

The design follows these general principles.  Each player is assigned a
unique number (playerID).  All of the information relating to that player
is tagged with his playerID.  The playerIDs are linked to names and 
birthdates in the MASTER table.

The database is comprised of the following main tables:

  MASTER - Player names, DOB, and biographical info
  Batting - batting statistics
  Pitching - pitching statistics
  Fielding - fielding statistics

It is supplemented by these tables:

  AllStarFull - All-Star appearances
  HallofFame - Hall of Fame voting data
  Managers - managerial statistics
  Teams - yearly stats and standings 
  BattingPost - post-season batting statistics
  PitchingPost - post-season pitching statistics
  TeamFranchises - franchise information
  FieldingOF - outfield position data  
  FieldingPost- post-season fieldinf data
  ManagersHalf - split season data for managers
  TeamsHalf - split season data for teams
  Salaries - player salary data
  SeriesPost - post-season series information
  AwardsManagers - awards won by managers 
  AwardsPlayers - awards won by players
  AwardsShareManagers - award voting for manager awards
  AwardsSharePlayers - award voting for player awards
  Appearances - details on the positions a player appeared at
  Schools - list of colleges that players attended
  SchoolsPlayers - list of players and the colleges they attended


Sections 2.1 through 2.24 of this document describe each of the tables in
detail and the fields that each contains.
